# Minecraft-Panel
A panel for starting and stopping the associated Minecraft server.  
Its purpose is to save processor, memory, and power usage.

This does so by allowing player's to start the server when they wish to play and turn it off when they're done.

Its intended for use in small trustworthy communities where abuse isn't an issue.

## Usage

Create a folder inside your Minecraft server, and drag this project into it.

Install the dependancy via 'npm install' inside said folder.

Edit config.json and name your server's Java file and your minimum / maximum memory.

Run your server by typing 'node index.js' inside of this folder.

Your panel will be able to be viewed at http://<your server's IP>:25564.
